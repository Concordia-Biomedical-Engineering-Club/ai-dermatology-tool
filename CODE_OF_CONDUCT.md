# Our Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As members of the AI Dermatology Tool project, we are committed to creating a welcoming, respectful, and collaborative environment for everyone. We believe that a diverse and inclusive team is a strong team, and we welcome participants from all backgrounds and experience levels.

Our goal is to create a space where everyone feels valued and has the opportunity to do their best work.

## Our Principles

To achieve this, we agree to follow these simple principles:

1.  **Be Respectful.**
    Treat everyone with respect and kindness. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or personal attacks. Value different perspectives and experiences.

2.  **Collaborate Constructively.**
    Our work is a team effort. When giving feedback, focus on the code and the ideas, not the person. When receiving feedback, assume good intent and accept it gracefully.

3.  **Be Supportive.**
    Help each other out. Share knowledge, offer assistance, and celebrate each other's successes. We succeed and fail as a team.

## Addressing Concerns

If you experience or witness behavior that does not align with these principles, or if you have any other concerns, we encourage you to address them.

Please contact the project lead at `youssefjedidi2022 [at] gmail [dot] com`.

All reports will be handled with discretion and fairness. We are committed to ensuring that our community is a safe and positive space for all members.
